Building a 4 wheeled service bot
I am a colloege teacher in ntario Canada.  I teach heavy Equipm,ermnt repair.  With so many vehicles going to a self driving model, I wanted to get a head start on learning Autonomous vehicle control so I can teach it to my students when the day comes.  I have converted a small ATV to electric drive and streering.  Hoping to use a Jetson Nano with object detection, voice commands, and lidar guidance.
